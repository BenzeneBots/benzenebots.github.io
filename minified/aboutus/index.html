But more importantly, Benzene Bots is a program that inspires students to acquire and apply STEM skills to pursue great goals in their lifetimes. Our mission is not only to inspire students' interest in STEM, but to prepare them for the work world and equip them with the skills necessary to be successful, being a consistent resource every stage of the learning process. FIRST and Benzene Bots teach important technical, managerial, and public relations skills to their members and community. Team involvement also strengthens students' life skills, particularly their organization, dedication, and capacity for hard work.</div></div></main>
