                                In the Design group, our main job or task is to understand our game rules given to us in
                                January with the release of the new game and we use those rules to design a robot.
                                When designing the robot, this group will be using CAD Software in order to accurately
                                design a robot.
                                The primary CAD software used by the team is SolidWorks.

                                In the fabrication group we focus on many things.
                                However our main focus is to take what the Design group comes up with in CAD and be able
                                to make that drawing into a real life item.
                                The fabrication team works closely with the Design team to ensure a solid robot design
                                for the year.
                                As a member of the fabrication team you will learn how to use a myriad of tools some of
                                which include:
                                <ul>

                                In the Electrical group, your main job will be to develop the electrical systems on
                                board the robot and make sure that power is distributed to the subsystems in order for
                                the robot to function properly.
                                The electrical group uses a variety of motors and motor controllers and to be a part of
                                this group it is necessary to understand the function of each part and how they work
                                together.

                                In the programming group, the main task that should be completed is creating the code in
                                order to make the robot move.
                                The programming group creates the software for the robot and also will make software
                                patches when needed. The coding language used for programming in our team is Java.
                                It is ok to join the programming group with no prior knowledge of programming since we
                                will teach it to you.
